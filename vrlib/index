#  
#  Visualruby was designed specifically for rubyists who want to add
#  a GUI to their ruby scripts.  It enormously simplifies the process
#  of adding GTK+ windows to your applications.  Visualruby is completely
#  integrated with the glade interface designer, so you only need to
#  click on a ruby file to edit its widgets using glade.
#  
#  The editor has a "Run=F5" button to execute your script, and if an error
#  occurs, the editor will automatically jump to the spot in your code
#  that caused the error.  Also, you can create a .gemspec file, compile your
#  gem, install your gem, or push, yank or uninstall your gem with
#  just one mouse-click.
