=Quick Start 

First, Download visualruby. Once you've installed it, run it by typing:

	vr

Video:quickstart.avi


When started, visualruby will try to open the current directory, then present you with choices of
folders to open.

it will copy several example projects
into a folder named "home/visualruby/examples" in your home directory:

	/home/yourname/visualruby/examples

You can open projects at any time by clicking on the "Open Project" button on the
toolbar.  Then click on "Run."  If you look in Tools>Settings, you
can see the command line that will execute when the "Run" button is pressed.

Navigate through the file tree, and try right clicking on the files.  You can create
or edit a glade GUI file from any ruby script.

When you want to create your own project, you can click "Open Project," and open
an empty folder, or an existing folder with ruby scripts in it.  If you open an
empty folder, a small "hello world" program will be added as a "scaffold" to help you.


Things to remember when using Visual Ruby:

*	Always name your files identically to your class.  For example,  a file that defines "MyClass" should be named "MyClass.rb"


*	In glade, always leave the default name, "window1" for the top window.  Visual Ruby's library (GladeGUI) finds each window using that name.

  
*	When designing forms in glade, assign names to your widgets that correspond to your instance variables. For example, and EntryBox should be named <b>var1</b>.  Then the EntryBox will auto-fill with the value of @var1.
