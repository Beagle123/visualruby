# Create Great GUIs using Ruby and Glade

Visualruby was designed specifically for rubyists who want to add
a GUI to their ruby scripts.  It enormously simplifies the process
of adding GTK+ windows to your applications.  Visualruby is completely
integrated with the glade interface designer, so you only need to
click on a ruby file to edit its widgets using glade.

The editor has a "Run=F5" button to execute your script, and if an error
occurs, the editor will automatically jump to the spot in your code
that caused the error.  Also, you can create a .gemspec file, compile your
gem, install your gem, or push, yank or uninstall your gem with
just one mouse-click.
