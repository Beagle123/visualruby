When installed, visualruby will create a folder:

  /home/yourname/visualruby


This is where you should keep all your visualruby projects.

You can open projects at any time by clicking on the "Open Project" button on the
toolbar.  Then click on "Run."  If you look in Tools -- Settings, you
can see the command line that will execute when the "Run" button is pressed.

## Try Editing the Glade Files

Try right-clicking on a .rb file, and edit its glade file.  You'll see that the glade
file's name maps[Ruby Gnome Forum](http://www.ruby-forum.com/forum/gnome2) to the class of the calling file:

  MyClass.rb => MyClass.glade

## Play With all the Examples

Each example is designed to teach a lesson in visualruby, and every project will
show you great time saving tricks.  Run each example, and understand the code.  It will
onlt take a short time.
