When installed, visualruby will create a folder named "/home/yourname/visualruby".
This is where you should keep all your visualruby projects.

You can open projects at any time by clicking on the "Open Project" button on the
toolbar.  Then click on "Run."  If you look in Tools -- Settings, you
can see the command line that will execute when the "Run" button is pressed.

Try right-clicking on a .rb file, and edit its glade file.  

# Things to remember when using Visual Ruby:

*	Always name your files identically to your class.  For example,  a file that defines "MyClass" should be named "MyClass.rb"


*	In glade, always leave the default name, "window1" for the top window.  Visual Ruby's library (GladeGUI) finds each window using that name.

  
*	When designing forms in glade, assign names to your widgets that correspond to your instance variables. For example, and EntryBox should be named <b>var1</b>.  Then the EntryBox will auto-fill with the value of @var1.
