## Try the Example Projects

Once started, visualruby will open one of the example projects.  Click the *Run" button
to try it. 

You can open and run each example project using the *Open Project*, and *Run* buttons:

Try browsing the code using the file tree on the left, and edit the glade files
by right-clicking on one of the ruby (.rb) files.

Each example is designed to teach a lesson in visualruby, and every project will
show you great time saving tricks.  Run each example, and study the code.  It will
onlt take a short time.  There are many examples you can learn from:

## Visual Ruby will Create Home Folder

When installed, visualruby will create a folder:

  /home/yourname/visualruby

This is where you should keep all your visualruby projects.

When you create a project in the */visualruby* folder, it will then appear
when you click the *Open Project* button on the toolbar.  

## Try Editing the Glade Files

Try right-clicking on a .rb file, and edit its glade file.  You'll see that the glade
file's name maps the glade file name to the class of the calling file:

  MyClass.rb => MyClass.glade


## Learn Gtk

Visualruby is written entirely in Gtk, so every part of visualruby is a subclas of a Gtk object.
Therefore, you have the entire Gtk library of classes that can be used in visualruby.  Also,
all the properties and methods of the Gtk parent classes can be used on the visualruby classes.

For example, the class VR::ListView is a subclass of Gtk::TreeView.  So you can use all of Gtk::TreeView's
methods and instance variables.
